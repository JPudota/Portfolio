					<p>I was on the lookout for a unique project to showcase in my data portfolio ‚Äî something that is
						interesting.
						That‚Äôs when I stumbled across the NZTA Open Data Portal. Among the many datasets, the Crash
						Analysis System
						caught my eye.
						The idea of using real-world crash data to uncover patterns and maybe even contribute to road
						safety
						conversations felt both important and interesting. So, I downloaded the dataset and decided to
						see what
						stories our roads have been telling ‚Äî using Python, a Jupyter notebook, and a lot of curiosity.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major"></h3>
					<h2>üìÇ Getting the Data Ready</h2>

					<p>
						To get started, I downloaded the crash data directly from NZTA‚Äôs open data portal.<br>
						(https://opendata-nzta.opendata.arcgis.com) <br>
						I used the CSV file updated on <strong>7th July 2025</strong>, which contains a massive
						<strong>885,184
							records</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>
						The dataset includes a lot of details ‚Äî everything from the time and location of each crash to
						road
						conditions, environmental factors, vehicle movements, and more.
						Naturally, the first thing I did was load the data into Pandas and run a few quick checks like
						<code>.shape</code>, <code>.head()</code>, and <code>.info()</code> just to get a feel for what
						I was working
						with.
					</p>

					<p>
						As with most real-world datasets, not all columns were useful for the kind of analysis I had in
						mind. Many of
						them were IDs, repetitive codes, or too specific (things like <code>OBJECTID</code>,
						<code>X</code>,
						<code>Y</code>, <code>meshblockId</code>, and so on).
					</p>

					<p>One major advantage of this dataset is the comprehensive field descriptions provided on the NZTA
						portal, which
						made it easier to decide which columns to drop.
					</p>

					<p>
						So, I did a bit of cleanup using <code>df.drop()</code> ‚Äî narrowing it down to the columns that
						could actually
						help tell a story. I focused on fields like
						<strong>crash severity</strong>, <strong>region</strong>, <strong>weather conditions</strong>,
						<strong>time of
							day</strong>, and <strong>vehicle movement</strong>.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major"></h3>
					<h2>üßº Cleaning Up</h2>
					The dataset was relatively clean, but I still had to:
					<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 40px;">
						<li>Drop irrelevant or highly sparse columns</li>
						<li>Handle any missing values if necessary (mostly negligible in this dataset)</li>
						<li>Convert certain columns like dates or categorical codes into more readable formats</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This step is like prepping ingredients before cooking ‚Äî it makes the rest of the process much
						smoother.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major"></h3>
					<h2>üìä Let‚Äôs Visualize</h2>
					<h3>üö® Crash Severity Counts</h3><br>
					<p>
						I started with a simple countplot of crash severity levels. This gave a clear snapshot of how
						many crashes
						were minor vs. serious or fatal.
						Unsurprisingly, <strong>non-injury and minor-injury crashes made up the bulk</strong> ‚Äî but the
						number of
						fatal crashes was still significant.
					</p>

						width="700" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 90%; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
					<br>

					<h3>üìÖ Crashes by Year</h3>
					<p>
						Next, I wanted to understand how crash volumes have changed over time ‚Äî so I plotted the number
						of crashes per
						year.
						This gave a nice visual trend of the highs and lows across the dataset. There is interesting
						cyclical
						behaviour. Obviously the 2025 year is incomplete, so we do not take that in account.
						As you can see, some years like <strong>2007, 2008 and 2017 saw the highest number of
							crashes</strong>, while
						the numbers have gradually dipped in more recent years ‚Äî particularly post-2020.
					</p>
					<img src="assets/images/crash_system/crash_count_year.png" alt="Crashes by Year Plot"
						style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 90%; border: 1px solid #ccc;"><br>


					<h3>‚òÅÔ∏è Weather Conditions During Crashes</h3>
					<p> I was curious how much weather actually plays a role in crashes ‚Äî like, do more crashes really
						happen when
						it‚Äôs rainy or foggy? So I plotted the
						data to see what weather conditions were most common during crash events. </p>

					<p> Turns out, most crashes actually happened in <strong>fine weather ‚Äî over 685,000 of
							them!</strong> At first
						that felt counter intuitive,
						but then I realized most people drive in good weather, so statistically, more crashes are just
						likely to
						happen then. Still, there were a
						substantial number of crashes during <strong>light rain (133k)</strong> and even <strong>heavy
							rain
							(35k)</strong>, which makes sense ‚Äî
						wet roads can easily lead to poor control or longer stopping distances. </p>

					<p> Less frequent weather types like <strong>fog, snow, and hail</strong> had much lower counts, but
						they‚Äôre
						still worth noting. Even though those
						conditions aren‚Äôt common, they clearly still pose risk when they do happen. </p>

					<img src="assets/images/crash_system/crash_count_weather.png" alt="Crashes by Weather Conditions"
						style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 90%; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
					<br>

					<h3>üåó Crash Severity vs. Light Conditions</h3>
					<p> Next, I wanted to understand whether light conditions ‚Äî like daylight vs. darkness ‚Äî had any
						noticeable
						impact on the severity of crashes.
						So I created a visualization comparing <strong>crash severity levels across different lighting
							conditions</strong> (things like bright sun,
						overcast, dark, twilight, etc.). </p>

					<p> Unsurprisingly, the majority of crashes occurred in <strong>daylight conditions (either bright
							sun or
							overcast)</strong>,
						simply because that‚Äôs when most people are out on the roads. But what stood out more was the
						higher proportion
						of <strong>serious
							and fatal crashes in darker conditions</strong>.
						Even though fewer people drive at night or during twilight, those crashes tended to be more
						severe ‚Äî possibly
						due to reduced visibility or
						slower reaction times. </p>
					<p> There was also a small chunk of data where light conditions were marked as "Unknown." While it‚Äôs
						a tiny
						portion, it‚Äôs another reminder that real-world datasets often come with a few gaps or
						inconsistencies. </p>


					<img src="assets/images/crash_system/crash_severity_light.png"
						alt="Crash Severity vs Light Conditions"
						style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 90%; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
					<br>

					<h3>üìç Top 10 Regions with the Most Crashes</h3>
					<p> To get a sense of where crashes are most concentrated, I looked at the total number of crashes
						by region and
						pulled out the top 10.
						As you might guess, <strong>Auckland topped the list by a huge margin</strong>. With over
						300,000 crashes,
						it‚Äôs clear that population density a
						nd traffic volume are major contributing factors. </p>

					<p> Regions like <strong>Waikato, Canterbury, Wellington, and Bay of Plenty</strong> also made the
						list, each
						with tens of thousands of reported
						crashes. These are areas with significant road networks and a mix of urban and rural driving
						environments ‚Äî
						which likely adds to the risk. </p>

					<p> The chart below gives a quick snapshot of how the top regions compare. While some differences
						are expected
						based on size and population, it's still helpful to see how heavily skewed crash data can be
						geographically.
					</p>

					<img src="assets/images/crash_system/crash_severity_region.png" alt="Top 10 Regions"
						style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 90%; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
					<br>

					<h3>üß≠ Digging into Auckland: A Missed Opportunity</h3>
					<p> After seeing that Auckland had the highest number of crashes overall, I was curious to dig
						deeper ‚Äî
						specifically, <strong>which parts of
							Auckland were seeing the most incidents?</strong> To explore this, I filtered the data to
						look at the top 10
						sub-regions
						(or TLA areas) within Auckland. </p>
					<p> Unfortunately, the data hit a bit of a snag here. The <code>tlaName</code> field ‚Äî which should
						have
						contained detailed sub-region names ‚Äî
						mostly just said <strong>"Auckland"</strong> across the board. So instead of seeing specific
						areas like
						Manukau, WaitematƒÅ, or
						North Shore, the chart ended up showing just one aggregated value. </p>

					<p> It‚Äôs a good reminder that <strong>even open datasets come with limitations</strong>. Sometimes
						the fields
						you expect to be rich in detail
						aren‚Äôt as granular as you'd like, and that can cut an analysis short. Still, it was worth
						checking ‚Äî and it‚Äôs
						always useful to call these
						things out in a project. </p><br>

					<h3>üöó Vehicle Types and Crash Severity</h3>
					<p> One of the more insightful breakdowns I was curious about was how different <strong>types of
							vehicles were
							involved in crashes</strong> ‚Äî and
						more importantly, how those crashes varied in severity. </p>

					<p> To do this, I reshaped the data so I could look at vehicle types side-by-side with crash
						severity levels.
						The resulting chart compares how often each type of vehicle was involved in fatal, serious,
						minor, or
						non-injury crashes. </p>

					<p> Not surprisingly, <strong>cars,station wagons, and SUV's</strong> had the highest numbers
						overall ‚Äî they
						make up most of the traffic, after all.
						But a few things stood out: </p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 40px;">
						<li><strong>Motorcycles and bicycles</strong> had noticeably higher proportions of serious and
							fatal crashes compared to other vehicle types, which aligns with what we know about rider
							vulnerability.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Trucks and vans</strong> also had a significant number of crashes, including a
							sizable chunk of
							serious and fatal ones.
							I‚Äôm guessing their size and weight make collisions more dangerous.</li>

						<li><strong>Buses and school buses</strong> were involved far less frequently, but it‚Äôs still
							important to see
							how those numbers look
							given the number of passengers they carry.</li>
					</ul>

					<p> Overall, this visualization added another layer of context ‚Äî showing not just what vehicles were
						involved,
						but what the consequences
						tended to look like depending on the type.

						<img src="assets/images/crash_system/crash_severity_vehicletype.png" alt="Vehicle Types"
							style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 90%; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
						<br>

					<h3>üìç Crash Severity Across Top 10 Regions</h3>
					<p> To get a deeper understanding of regional road safety, I broke down crash severity across the
						top 10 regions
						with the most reported crashes.
						Unsurprisingly, <strong>Auckland led the list</strong> by a wide margin ‚Äî not just in overall
						crashes, but
						also in each severity category.
						This likely reflects its population size and vehicle density. </p>
					<p> However, other regions like <strong>Waikato, Canterbury, and Wellington</strong> also showed
						significantly
						high numbers, particularly for
						minor and non-injury crashes. Waikato stood out with over <strong>1,500 fatal crashes</strong>,
						which was
						notably higher than even some
						more populated regions. </p>
					<p> This view helped highlight which regions may need more targeted safety interventions ‚Äî whether
						that‚Äôs better
						infrastructure,
						awareness campaigns, or stricter enforcement depending on the local context. </p>

					<img src="assets/images/crash_system/top10_regions_crash_severity.png"
						alt="Crash severity by top 10 regions"
						style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 90%; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
					<br>

					<h3>üíÄ Fatal Crashes by Region</h3>

					<p> I plotted a line chart showing the number of <strong>fatal crashes by region</strong>.
						This gave a focused view of where the most tragic incidents are happening across the country.
					</p>
					<p> The results were quite striking. <strong>Waikato</strong> topped the list with over
						<strong>1,500 fatal
							crashes</strong>,
						followed by <strong>Auckland</strong> and <strong>Canterbury</strong>.
						This was interesting, especially because Auckland, despite having more total crashes, had fewer
						fatal ones
						than Waikato.
						This could point to differences in road conditions, speed zones, or emergency response times.
					</p>

					<p> As we move down the list, we see regions like <strong>West Coast, Marlborough, and
							Gisborne</strong>
						recording lower fatal crash counts ‚Äî
						but that doesn‚Äôt mean these areas are ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù These numbers also correlate with population size
						and traffic
						volume,
						so it‚Äôs important to interpret them in context. </p>

					<h2>üìù Final Thoughts</h2>
					<p> Exploring this crash data turned out to be more insightful than I expected. It started as a
						portfolio
						experiment, but diving into the numbers
						revealed patterns around regions, weather, light conditions, and vehicle types that really made
						me reflect on
						how many factors play a role in
						road safety.</p>
						<p>While there's still room to explore ‚Äî like diving into predictive modeling or spatial heatmaps ‚Äî
						this analysis
						already shows how much we can uncover from open crash data. I'm glad I followed this idea
						through.. </p>
