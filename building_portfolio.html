					<p>
						Coming back to work after a three-year career break wasn’t as simple as updating my old resume.
						I was moving into <b>Data Analytics</b>, and it quickly became clear that a list of skills on
						paper wouldn’t be enough. Employers in this field want to see proof—real projects, dashboards,
						and examples that demonstrate practical experience.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major"></h3>
					<h2>Why I Needed a Portfolio?</h2>
					<p>As I researched job opportunities, I noticed a common trend: candidates who showcased their work
						had a stronger advantage. A portfolio doesn’t just say what tools you know; it shows how you
						apply them. That realization pushed me to create a space where I could highlight my projects,
						share my progress, and present my skills in action.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major"></h3>
					<h2>How I Got Started</h2>
					<p>I already had some knowledge of HTML, so instead of using a drag-and-drop website builder, I
						decided to build the site myself. I chose a solid state template from Html5up.net, customized it
						to fit my needs, and
						in the process, refreshed my coding skills. It felt good to have full control over the design
						rather than relying on pre-built layouts.</p>


					<h3 class="major"></h3>
					<h2>Building & Hosting the Site</h2>
					<p>To make the website accessible online, I used GitHub Pages—a free hosting option that works
						perfectly for personal projects. It integrates well with version control, which meant I could
						manage updates through Git.
						<br style="line-height:1;"> Seeing the site go live for the first time was a small but
						motivating win.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major"></h3>
					<h2>Adding Projects & Future Plans</h2>
					<p>Once the basic structure was ready, I began adding my data analytics projects—dashboards,
						visualizations, and reports that reflect my skills. This is just the beginning; I plan to keep
						updating the site as I learn more.
						<br style="line-height:1;">
						This blog section itself will serve as a way to document my journey—sharing what I’m learning,
						the challenges I face, and the milestones I hit along the way.
					</p>
					
					<h3 class="major"></h3>
					<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
					<p>Building this portfolio website has been more than a technical task; it’s been a step towards
						rebuilding my career with intention.
						<br style="line-height:1;">It’s a space that grows as I do, and I’m excited to see how it
						evolves as I continue to develop my skills in data analytics.
